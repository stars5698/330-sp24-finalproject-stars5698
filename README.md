Final Project for JavaScript 330B Spring 2024 

Proposal and Task Breakdown
Your Final Project proposal is due. You should submit a link to a GitHub project that will house your submission. The project README should contain your project proposal. Your proposal should include:

1. A description of the scenario your project is operating in.
   - The user is a customer for a grocery store. Before they make their trip to the store, they need to make sure that they know what items they plan to purchase. 

2. A description of what problem your project seeks to solve.
   - People are busy nowadays, and that includes the fact that they are running errands. This API will allow users to maintain a grocery shopping list where they list items they plan to purchase whether it is for them or for their entire family. This will help the user stay organized and not forget what they need. 

3. A description of what the technical components of your project will be, including: the routes, the data models, any external data sources you'll use, etc.

4. Clear and direct call-outs of how you will meet the various project requirements.

5. A timeline for what project components you plan to complete, week by week, for the remainder of the class.
